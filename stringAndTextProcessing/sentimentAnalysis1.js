/*
Here, we will use two arrays of words. One array contains words that connote a 
"positive" sentiment, while the other contains words that connote a "negative" 
sentiment. Given the counts of positive and negative words in our text, we can 
compute a sentiment score as the difference between the two counts, "positive 
word count - negative word count." The sentiment of the text is positive if the 
difference is positive, negative if the difference is negative, and neutral if 
the difference is 0 (the word counts are equal).

Implement a function that takes some text as an argument and logs some information
about whether the text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
